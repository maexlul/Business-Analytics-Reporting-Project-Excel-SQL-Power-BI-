business analytics (excel,sql,powerbi)

This project delivers an end-to-end business analytics solution by integrating sales, customer, and product data to generate actionable insights through structured analysis and interactive dashboards.

Three relational tables: customers, products, and sales, linked using primary and foreign keys.
Sales data includes order date, quantity, revenue, and profit for transactional and time-based analysis.
Customer data captures demographics and segmentation details for customer-level insights.
Product data includes category, cost, and pricing information for margin and profitability analysis.
Data types and relationships were standardized to ensure accuracy and analytical consistency.
